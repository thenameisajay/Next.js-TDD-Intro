 # Introduction to Test-Driven Development with Next.js

## Overview
This repository serves as an introductory guide to implementing Test-Driven Development (TDD) within the Next.js framework. Although the project presented here is relatively modest in scope, it aims to provide a solid foundation for understanding and applying TDD principles in Next.js development projects.

## Technology Stack
The project leverages a combination of technologies and tools integral to modern web development, specifically within the React ecosystem. These include:

- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications.
- **Jest**: A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity, used for writing unit and integration tests.
- **React Testing Library**: A set of helpers that allow you to test React components without relying on their implementation details, promoting better testing practices.
- **Cypress**: An end-to-end testing framework designed to provide a robust testing environment for web applications, ensuring that they work as expected in a real browser.
- **Yarn**: A fast, reliable, and secure dependency management tool.

## Current Limitations
- **Dynamic Import Issue**: There is a known issue with the `yarn` command related to dynamic imports ([Yarn Issue #8994](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/8994)). This problem can cause dynamic imports to fail during execution. A temporary workaround involves removing the `yarn.lock` file and reinstalling the packages to resolve the issue.
